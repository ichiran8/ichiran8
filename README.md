## Hi there 👋
My name is Jerry Chen!
I am currently a graduate student studying Electrical Computer Engineering with a focus on VLSI design and Computer Architecture!

In my free time I love designing and working on computer architecture work! 

--> My latest RTL project includes the testing of my Dual Core Superscalar CPU with support for the RISC-V base integer instruction set as well as a few atomic instructions for lock design!\
--> Recently I implemented a Waiting Instruction Buffer (WIB) in GEM5 (not publicly available for students) based on the original paper's WIB spec, although with a more modern OoO pipeline\
--> Reach out to me about my design! I am happy to answer any questions you have about the architecture I designed the CPU around! \

I also love SoC's and semiconductors! Feel free to reach out to me if you want to work on a project toegether ! 👯


🔭 I’m currently working on a R10K styled RISC-V CPU with 2-way Superscaling with plans to add MULTICORE(!) and SMT to the design! I'm hoping that I can model this on a C++ simulator like GEM5 to explore more advanced designs in the future. Also, C++ is something I'm working on improving!

⚡ Fun fact: I also love playing soccer and volleyball in my free time with friends! Sometimes I dabble in some Valorant, Minecraft, and some reading!
