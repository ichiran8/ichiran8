## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jerry Chen!
I am currently an undergraduate student at Purdue University studying Electrical Computer Engineering!

In my free time I love designing and working on computer architecture work! 

  --> My latest project includes the testing of my Dual Core Superscalar CPU with support for the RISC-V base integer instruction set as well as a few atomic instructions for lock design!
  
  --> Reach out to me about my design! I am happy to answer any questions you have about the architecture I designed the CPU around! 

I also love SoC's and semiconductors! Feel free to reach out to me if you want to work on a project toegether ! ðŸ‘¯


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a R10K CPU with 2-way Superscaling with plans to add MULTICORE(!) and SMT to the design! I'm hoping that I can model this on a C++ simulator like GEM5 to explore more advanced designs in the future. Also, C++ is something I'm working on improving!

âš¡ Fun fact: I also love playing soccer and volleyball in my free time with friends! Sometimes I dabble in some Valorant, Minecraft, and some reading!

ðŸ“« Reach out to me at jerrychxn10@gmail.com or chen4419@purdue.edu! Thanks!
