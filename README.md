## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jerry Chen!
I am currently an undergraduate student at Purdue University studying Electrical Computer Engineering! In my free time I love designing and working on computer architecture work! My latest project includes the testing of my Dual Core Superscalar CPU with support for the RISC-V base integer instruction set as well as a few atomic instructions for lock design!

I also love SoC's and semiconductors! Feel free to reach out to me if you want to work on a project toegether ! ðŸ‘¯

**ichiran8/ichiran8** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a R10K CPU with 2-way Superscaling with plans to add MULTICORE(!) and SMT to the design! I'm hoping that I can model this on a C++ simulator like GEM5 to explore more advanced designs in the future. Also, C++ is something I'm working on improving!

âš¡ Fun fact: I also love playing soccer and volleyball in my free time with friends! Sometimes I dabble in some Valorant, Minecraft, and some reading!
